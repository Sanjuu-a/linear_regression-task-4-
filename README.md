# House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning 🏡📊 
## linear_regression-task-4-

Summary: 
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as house area, basement area, number of floors, built year, renovation year, and location factors (proximity to schools and airports). Using Linear Regression, we analyze feature importance and evaluate model performance with metrics like RMSE and R².

Key Steps in the Project
✅ Data Preprocessing: Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler
✅ Feature Selection: Used correlation heatmaps to select the most influential factors
✅ Model Training: Implemented Linear Regression for prediction
✅ Evaluation Metrics: Measured Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R² Score
✅ Visualization

* Plotted Actual vs Predicted Prices
* Analyzed Feature Coefficients to understand their impact

Results and Observations
🔹 House area and basement size have the highest influence on price
🔹 Older houses tend to have lower prices (negative coefficient for Built Year)
🔹 Distance from the airport and number of schools have a minor impact
🔹 Model has some prediction errors, visible in the scatter plot below
